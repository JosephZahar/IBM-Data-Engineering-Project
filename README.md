# IBM-Data-Engineering-Project
We will apply foundational Python skills by implementing different techniques to collect and work with data. Playing the role of a Data Engineer and extract data from multiple file formats, transform it into specific datatypes, and then load it into a single source for analysis. We will also implement webscraping and extracting data with APIs to gather informations from new data sources. This project aims to collect large datasets from multiple sources and transform them into one primary source, and web scraping to gain valuable business insights all with the use of Python.
